# The Shifting Sands of Startup Scaling
## How AI Is changing the way tech companies scale
<p>CreateFuture<br/>Glasgow Tech Meetup</p>

> Welcome everyone. Thanks for coming.
> Tonight, we're diving into a really exciting topic: how Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally reshaping the journey of tech startups, particularly when it comes to scaling.
> We'll explore the shifts in strategies, team structures, and the overall speed at which companies can now grow.

---

## What Are We Going to Talk About?

### Tonight's Journey: Two Companies, One Product, Radically Different Approaches

**We'll explore:**
* **Two (made up) Companies:** Traditional vs. AI-powered approaches to building the same solution
* **Key Phases:** MVP development and scaling challenges

> To make this tangible, we'll follow the journey of two fictitious companies.
> Both are tasked with building the exact same product, but they'll take radically different paths to get there. One will use a traditional, well-trodden startup approach. The other will embrace AI from the very beginning.
> We'll look at how they tackle building their Minimum Viable Product, or MVP, and then consider the distinct scaling challenges each approach presents.

---

## The Core Question

How does AI fundamentally change the way we build and scale tech companies?

<img src="to-the-future.jpeg" alt="Traditional vs AI-powered workflows" class="core-question-image">

> This brings us to the central question of the talk.
> We're not just looking at incremental changes. We're asking: How does AI fundamentally rewrite the playbook for building and scaling technology companies?
> This image here visualizes that shift from older, more manual workflows to a future where AI is an integral partner.

# Build VeriCask's **ChainTrace** Platform

<img src="vericast-logo.jpeg" alt="VeriCask Logo" class="vericask-logo">

### What is ChainTrace?

ChainTrace is a whisky authentication platform using secure NFC tags and digital certificates. It tracks each bottle's complete journey from distillation to consumer, enabling instant verification via smartphone and protecting collectors' investments through tamper-proof provenance records.

> Let's introduce our product: ChainTrace, developed by the (fictitious) company VeriCask.
> Imagine a high-end solution for a niche market: authenticating expensive bottles of whisky.
> ChainTrace uses secure NFC tags embedded in the bottles and digital certificates on a blockchain to track a bottle's entire journey. Consumers can then instantly verify authenticity with their smartphone, protecting their investment. It’s about tamper-proof provenance.

---

## VeriCask StandardBuild: The Traditional Approach

**StandardBuild** follows the conventional tech startup playbook: secure funding, hire specialists for each function, and build teams around established DevOps and Agile practices.

> Our first company, "VeriCask StandardBuild," takes the traditional route.
> Think of the classic startup playbook: First, secure seed funding. Then, hire specialist teams for each key function – marketing, engineering, operations, etc.
> They'll build their processes around established methodologies like DevOps and Agile, focusing on human expertise to drive development.

---

## VeriCask AI-Optima: The AI-Powered Approach

**AI-Optima** takes a radically different path: deeply integrate AI tools across all business functions from day one.

Their philosophy prioritises capital efficiency and agility, maintaining a small core team skilled in AI augmentation to automate tasks and amplify human capabilities.

> Now, meet "VeriCask AI-Optima." They're taking a completely different path.
> Their strategy is to embed AI tools and processes deeply into every business function right from the start.
> The core philosophy here is capital efficiency and extreme agility. This means maintaining a very small, core team where individuals are skilled in using AI to augment their own capabilities, automate tasks, and achieve more with less.
> They anticipate higher tool costs but a significantly smaller human headcount.

---

## Initial Operations & MVP Build-Out

**Let's take these two companies, and look at how they might approach key areas in an early startup lifecycle:**

* Marketing & Content Creation
* Internal Operations (Admin, Finance)
* UI Development
* Backend Development
* Testing & Quality Assurance
* Customer Support

> So, let's put these two hypothetical companies side-by-side and examine how they might approach building out their MVP.
> We'll look at six key operational areas that are crucial in the early lifecycle of a startup:
> Marketing and how they create content.
> Internal operations – the admin, finance, legal side of things.
> How they approach UI development.
> Backend engineering.
> Testing and quality assurance.
> And finally, customer support.

---

## Marketing - VeriCask StandardBuild

<div class="headcount">StandardBuild: 2 people</div>

<div class="ldiv">

![Traditional Marketing Team](traditional-marketing.jpeg)

</div>

<div class="rdiv">

Dedicated marketing staff create blogs, social posts, and PR campaigns through traditional creative processes and channel outreach.

</div>

> First up, marketing. For StandardBuild, we're looking at a typical setup.
> They'd likely hire a couple of dedicated marketing professionals.
> These individuals would be responsible for creating blogs, managing social media, running PR campaigns, perhaps organizing events, and leveraging their media contacts.
> It's a human-driven, often labor-intensive process, relying on traditional creative workflows and outreach.

---

## Marketing - VeriCask AI-Optima

<div class="headcount">AI-Optima: 1 person</div>

One marketing lead uses AI to repurpose content, generate tweets, refine blog posts, and create steady content streams with minimal manual intervention.

<img src="ai-marketing.jpeg" alt="AI-powered marketing workflow" class="core-question-image">

> AI-Optima, on the other hand, approaches marketing very differently.
> They might have just one marketing lead, or perhaps even a founder taking this on initially.
> This person would leverage AI tools extensively – think tools like Jasper.ai or similar platforms – to generate first drafts of blog posts, white papers, repurpose content across different social media channels, and even schedule posts.
> The focus is on using AI for volume and initial creation, with the human element providing curation, strategic oversight, and refinement. This creates a steady content stream with far less manual effort.

---

## Internal Operations

<div class="div">

<div class="headcount-left">StandardBuild: 4 people</div>

### The Traditional Approach

Founders and admin staff handle email drafting, legal reviews, expense tracking, invoicing, and pitch deck preparation through traditional human-intensive processes. Operations staff also manage payroll, HR, and compliance tasks manually, increasing overhead as the company grows.

</div>

<div class="rdiv">

<div class="headcount-right">AI-Optima: 2 people</div>

### The AI-Powered Approach

Core founders use AI assistants for email drafting, contract reviews, pitch deck preparation, expense categorization, invoice processing, and documentation creation.

</div>

> Moving to internal operations – all the essential background tasks.
> **StandardBuild** would likely rely on founders and administrative staff. This team of around four would manually handle tasks like drafting emails, initial legal document reviews, tracking expenses, processing invoices, and preparing pitch decks. As they grow, they'd also take on payroll, HR, and compliance manually, which adds to overhead.
> **AI-Optima** aims for much leaner operations with perhaps two people. The core team would use AI assistants for many of these tasks: drafting emails, getting AI to perform initial contract reviews or highlight areas of concern, generating first drafts of pitch decks, automating expense categorization and invoice processing, and even assisting with creating internal documentation.

## Building the UI - VeriCask StandardBuild

<div class="headcount">StandardBuild: 11 people</div>

<div class="ldiv">

<img src="standard-build.jpeg" alt="Traditional UI development team" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

</div>

<div class="rdiv">

### The Traditional Approach

UI/UX designers and front-end developers follow established design sprints and development timelines with iterative design-development cycles.

</div>

> Now let's look at building the user interface.
> For **StandardBuild**, this is a significant team effort. We're estimating around 11 people, including UI/UX designers and front-end developers.
> They follow established processes: design sprints, user research, creating wireframes and mockups (perhaps in Figma), and then a handoff to front-end developers who implement the designs in code, using frameworks like React or Vue. This involves iterative cycles of design, development, and feedback.

---

## Building the UI - VeriCask AI-Optima

<div class="headcount">AI-Optima: 5 people</div>

<div class="ldiv">

### The AI-Powered Approach

UI/UX developers use AI-assisted builders like Firebase Studio for rapid prototyping, with AI generating components and suggesting layouts.

</div>

<div class="rdiv">

<img src="firebase-studio.png" alt="Firebase Studio AI-assisted UI development" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

</div>

> **AI-Optima** can achieve this with a much smaller team, say around 5 people.
> Their UI/UX developers would leverage AI-assisted builders. The slide mentions Firebase Studio, but think of tools like Framer's AI, Vercel's v0.dev, or others that allow for rapid prototyping where AI can generate components, suggest layouts, and even create interactive prototypes quickly.
> This allows for faster iteration, getting working concepts in front of users much sooner, and reducing the traditional handoff friction between design and development. While skilled developers are still needed for robust, production-ready code, the initial build and iteration are drastically accelerated.

---

## Building the Backend

<div class="ldiv">

<div class="headcount-left">StandardBuild: 18 people</div>

### The Traditional Approach

Backend developers manually write, debug, and test code with extensive human effort for core functionality and traditional code review processes.

</div>

<div class="rdiv">

<div class="headcount-right">AI-Optima: 11 people</div>

### The AI-Powered Approach

Backend developers use GitHub Copilot and AI coding agents to assist in code generation, debugging, and building secure ledger components.

</div>

> For the backend, the engine room of the platform:
> **StandardBuild** would have a substantial team of around 18 backend developers. They're manually writing, debugging, and testing all the code. This involves a lot of human effort for building core functionality, APIs, database interactions, and going through traditional code review processes.
> **AI-Optima** operates with a leaner backend team of about 11. Their developers are heavily augmented by AI. They use tools like GitHub Copilot for real-time code suggestions and generation. More advanced AI coding agents can assist with debugging, writing tests, and even scaffolding complex components like those needed for a secure ledger system. AI helps them write better code faster, and understand new domains or libraries more quickly.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

<div class="ldiv">
<div class="headcount-left">StandardBuild: 21 people</div>

### The Traditional Approach

Dedicated QA testers manually create test cases, execute testing plans, and conduct time-intensive testing cycles with significant human effort.

</div>

<div class="rdiv">

<div class="headcount-right">AI-Optima: 12 people</div>

### The AI-Powered Approach

Only 1 dedicated QA specialist, with the rest of the team using AI-powered testing tools (Playwright, LambdaTest, Co-Pilot) for automated test generation, execution, and coverage expansion.

</div>

> Testing and QA is critical.
> **StandardBuild** would likely have a dedicated team of QA testers, bringing their total here to around 21. These testers manually create detailed test cases, execute testing plans across different scenarios, and conduct thorough, but time-intensive, testing cycles.
> **AI-Optima**, with a team of about 12 in this area (this could be 1 QA specialist and developers empowered by AI tools), relies heavily on AI-powered testing. They might have one dedicated QA specialist focused on strategy and implementing AI testing tools like Playwright (which has excellent AI/codegen features, especially with Copilot) or LambdaTest. These tools can automate test generation from specifications or existing code, execute tests rapidly, and help expand test coverage significantly, reducing manual effort.

---

## Customer Support

<div class="ldiv">

<div class="headcount-left">StandardBuild: 23 people</div>

### The Traditional Approach

Dedicated support staff manually set up channels, create knowledge bases, and handle time-consuming customer response workflows.

</div>

<div class="rdiv">

<div class="headcount-right">AI-Optima: 13 people</div>

### The AI-Powered Approach

AI agents generate FAQs from documentation and manage calls and support tickets, with the core team handling only escalations.

</div>

> Finally, customer support.
> **StandardBuild**, now at a cumulative total of around 23 people, would typically hire dedicated support staff. This team would manually set up support channels, painstakingly create knowledge bases and FAQs, and handle customer inquiries through often time-consuming workflows.
> **AI-Optima**, with its core team of around 13, uses AI to transform this. AI agents can be trained on existing documentation (even code or videos) to automatically generate comprehensive FAQs and knowledge bases. These AI agents can then handle a large volume of initial customer calls and support tickets, with the small core human team stepping in only for complex escalations or issues the AI can't resolve.

## Summary: Two Approaches to Building VeriCask

<div class="ldiv">

<div class="headcount-left">StandardBuild: 23 people</div>

### Traditional Approach Results

* **Headcount to MVP:** **~23 individuals**
* **Key Challenges:**
  * Longer time-to-market
  * Higher initial burn rate
  * Competition for hiring talent
  * Slower iteration cycles

</div>

<div class="rdiv">

<div class="headcount-right">AI-Optima: 13 people</div>

### AI-Powered Approach Results

* **Headcount to MVP:** **~13 AI-augmented individuals**
* **Key Challenges:**
  * Smaller team may hit scaling/organizational issues sooner and be less prepared to handle them
  * Finding AI-skilled talent

</div>

> So, let's summarize what it took for both companies to get to their MVP.
> **StandardBuild** ended up with a team of approximately 23 individuals. Their key challenges are likely to be a longer time-to-market due to manual processes, a higher initial burn rate because of the larger payroll, intense competition for hiring specialized talent, and generally slower iteration cycles.
> **AI-Optima**, in contrast, built their MVP with a core team of around 13 AI-augmented individuals. Their challenges are different: such a small, fast-moving team might hit scaling and organizational bottlenecks sooner and could be less prepared for the complexities of managing rapid growth. Finding talent skilled in effectively leveraging AI is also a critical challenge.

---

## Navigating Growth: Scaling Challenges

At Create Future, we usually see three broad areas that need attention when companies hit a certain point in their scaling:

* Strategy and Direction
* Delivery and Execution
* Foundations and Enablement

> Building the MVP is just the first step. The real test comes when it's time to scale.
> At Create Future, when we work with companies hitting that growth inflection point, we typically see challenges and opportunities falling into three broad categories:
> First, **Strategy and Direction**: Is the vision clear? Is the product strategy coherent?
> Second, **Delivery and Execution**: Can the team build and ship effectively as demand grows?
> And third, **Foundations and Enablement**: Are the underlying systems, processes, and culture in place to support sustained growth?
> AI impacts all of these.

---

## Some things stay the same

* **North Star & Product Strategy** - Clear vision for VeriCask and coherent product strategy with market positioning and prioritisation guidance.
* **Cloud Architecture** - Robust, scalable, secure architecture for ChainTrace with infrastructure to support growing customer base.
* **Platform Security** - Protection of VeriCask platform and ChainTrace ledger with customer data security and compliance.

> Now, it's important to note that AI doesn't change everything. Certain fundamentals remain critical regardless of your approach.
> You still need a clear **North Star and Product Strategy**. For VeriCask, this means a clear vision for ChainTrace, a coherent strategy that defines its market position, and guidance on prioritization.
> A robust, scalable, and secure **Cloud Architecture** is non-negotiable. The ChainTrace platform needs an infrastructure that can support a growing customer base reliably.
> And **Platform Security** is paramount, especially for a product like ChainTrace dealing with valuable assets and sensitive data. Protecting the platform, the ledger, customer data, and ensuring compliance are always essential.

---

## But there are differences too...

* **Goals and outcomes** - Smaller businesses will find it significantly easier to align their businesses around certain goals.
* **Engineering practices** - Smaller teams will find it much easier to align on engineering practices, and AI can help with definition, implementation and enforcement of everything from CI/CD to coding practices.
* **Tech stacks** - A key driver for changing tech-stacks is scaling across a number of different teams and hiring for certain skills. AI makes it easier to make the shift, makes skills less important and keeps teams smaller to delay the decision
---

> However, AI introduces significant differences in how startups can navigate scaling.
> With **Goals and Outcomes**, smaller, AI-augmented businesses often find it much easier to align the entire company around specific objectives. There are fewer layers and communication is more direct.
> When it comes to **Engineering Practices**, smaller teams naturally align more easily. AI can further streamline this by helping to define, implement, and even enforce standards – from CI/CD pipelines to coding best practices and documentation.
> And **Tech Stacks**: Traditionally, a major reason to change tech stacks is the difficulty of scaling development across many teams or hiring for niche skills. AI can alleviate this. It can make it easier for smaller teams to work with diverse technologies, reduces the critical importance of specific pre-existing skills (as AI can bridge gaps), and allows teams to stay smaller for longer, potentially delaying or even avoiding complex and costly tech stack migrations.

## And some you don't worry about at all...

* One of the biggest headaches for a scale-up is organisation design and 'Scaling teams'
* Time spent re-drawing org charts and learning what a platform team is, and how it's different from the spotify model is time not providing value to the business
* Smaller teams get longer without hitting that pain point, and may chose never to get to it
---

> Perhaps most strikingly, AI might help startups avoid some traditional scaling headaches altogether.
> One of the biggest time-sinks for a rapidly growing scale-up is **organizational design** – figuring out how to structure teams, defining roles like "platform teams," and trying to implement models like the "Spotify model."
> All the time spent re-drawing org charts and debating these structures is time not directly providing value to customers or the business.
> AI-powered, leaner teams can operate effectively for much longer without hitting these complex organizational pain points. They might even choose to structure themselves differently long-term, bypassing some of these traditional hurdles entirely.

## Key Takeaways

### The AI Advantage in Startup Scaling

* **Dramatic Team Size Reduction:** AI-powered approach requires ~70% fewer people (8 vs 25+ for MVP)
* **Faster Time-to-Market:** AI tools enable rapid prototyping, automated testing, and streamlined workflows
* **Capital Efficiency:** Lower burn rate through reduced headcount and operational overhead
* **Quality at Scale:** AI assists in maintaining quality while moving faster with smaller teams
---

> So, what are the key takeaways from this comparison?
> The AI advantage in startup scaling is significant.
> First, as the slide notes, there's a potential for **Dramatic Team Size Reduction**. (The slide mentions ~70% fewer people with an 8 vs 25+ example; based on our VeriCask model, we saw a reduction from 23 to 13, which is about 43%. The principle is clear: AI enables much smaller teams.)
> This leads to **Faster Time-to-Market**. AI tools accelerate everything from prototyping and development to automated testing and streamlined operational workflows.
> It drives **Capital Efficiency**. A smaller headcount and reduced operational overhead mean a lower burn rate, making funding go further.
> And importantly, it's about achieving **Quality at Scale**. AI isn't just about speed or cost-cutting; it can assist in maintaining high quality standards even when teams are small and moving quickly.
