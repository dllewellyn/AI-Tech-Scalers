For presentation files, please follow these instructions:
 
* When asked to put an image into the slide, prefer markdown syntax over HTML if possible
* Use the `![alt text](image_url)` syntax for images
* When asked to do 'split screen' consider whether the previous screen was split screen and if so, use the same split screen format but reversed. For example, if the image is on the left on the previous slide and the text on the right, place the image on the right and the text on the left for the next slide.
* When using 'marp' prefer marp specific syntax where possible. The user knows what they want, but does not know about Marp and what its capabilities are. 
* When using marp, think about what capabilities marp has and then use those if appropriate.
